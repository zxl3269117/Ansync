### How to use

2. `npm install` to install the app.
3. `npm link` to link CLI tool.
4. start using it by entering `print-from-url <url-to-the-resource>`.
5. key functions:
> `+` to speed up the printing by 0.5 second

> `-` to slow down the printing by 0.5 second

> `space` to stop printing and `space` again to restart printing.

### Troubleshoot
- If you don't have a url for resource
> This project included some sample files served locally. Go ahead and run `npm start` to start the server on port `1234`. Then use the `print-from-url http://localhost:1234/<sample-file>` to try out the tool.
