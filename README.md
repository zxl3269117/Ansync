## Project 1: CLI tool
Welcome to the `print-from-url` tool.

### Demo

### How to use
1. `cd project1` to go to the project 1 directory
2. `npm install` to install the app.
3. `print-from-url <url-to-the-resource>` to start printing the resource.
4. press `+` to speed up the printing by 0.5 second; press `-` to slow down the printing by 0.5 second; press ` ` to stop printing and press again to restart priting.

### Trouble shoot
- If you don't have a url for resource
> This project included some sample project with a server serving it. Go ahead and run `npm start` to start the server on port `1234`. Then use the `print-from-url http://localhost:1234/<sample-file>` to try out the tool.
